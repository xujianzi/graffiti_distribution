## Project Description
>Graffiti is regarded as painting ubiquitous on the city's wall or subway system. Our response to graffiti varies from recognition of social chaos to identifying it as art. Graffiti is a critical issue for the public. Individuals can be influenced by graffiti in different ways: some are attracted by its activity or its expression style, while others regard it as an indicator of youth criminality and social decline. Therefore, understanding what kinds of specific factors may influence graffiti spatial patterns is essential to help researchers learn the social significance and the citizens' attitude toward graffiti. Using a combination of census data, land use data, and geographic data, I identify nine factors with a significant correlation to graffiti density in New York City, NY, USA. It is found  that graffiti concentrate in residential and commercial areas with high density of young people. Crime rate, median household income, and poverty rate are highly correlated with graffiti distribution. In addition, this project finds that the Geographically Weighted Regression(GWR) model of these variables explains over 75% of the variation in graffiti reports. Further,  we also try to explore a new form of geographic information -- social media to serve as a source of graffiti data that can supplement or even replace the government graffiti data in the near future.
